# BuzzCut AI Implementation

## Overview
This project has been successfully transformed from a generic starter kit into a specialized BuzzCut AI application. The implementation includes all MVP features from the requirements document.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Buzz Cut Simulator (`components/product/buzz-cut-simulator.tsx`)
- **Real-time camera preview** - Use your camera to see live buzz cut simulation
- **Photo upload** - Upload photos for high-quality processing
- **Guard length control** - 12 different lengths from 1mm to 12mm
- **Hair color variations** - Natural, black, brown, blonde, gray options
- **HD download** - Download high-resolution results
- **Social sharing** - Share results with friends

### 2. API Integration (`app/api/buzzcut/route.ts`)
- REST API endpoint for image processing
- Simulated HairCLIPv2 integration (ready for production backend)
- Error handling and validation

### 3. Custom Hooks (`hooks/use-buzz-cut.ts`)
- State management for buzz cut processing
- Result history tracking
- Error handling

### 4. UI Components Created
- **Tabs** (`components/ui/tabs.tsx`) - For upload/camera switching
- **Slider** (`components/ui/slider.tsx`) - For guard length control
- **Badge** (`components/ui/badge.tsx`) - For UI labels

### 5. Brand Integration
- Updated logo to "BuzzCut AI" with scissors icon
- Modified hero section with buzz cut focus
- Updated features to highlight AI hair simulation
- Customized stats with relevant metrics
- FAQ section with buzz cut specific questions

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Set up AWS Lambda + GPU EC2 for HairCLIPv2
   - Implement image processing pipeline
   - Add S3 for image storage

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add image compression
   - Implement caching strategy
   - Optimize for Core Web Vitals

3. **Additional Features**
   - Add more hair colors
